# GAMS Studio

GAMS Studio is the official development environment of the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). For further information about GAMS please visit [GAMS](https://www.gams.com) or the [GAMS documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/).

# How to build

## 1. Download and install Qt ##

The recommended way to get Qt is via its official [Qt online installer](https://www.qt.io/).
If you are interested in the Qt sources you can download them through the 
installer or build Qt from scratch by following the [Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/build-sources.html).
Alternatively, you can get and build Qt from the official [Qt GitHub mirror](https://github.com/qt/qt5).

## 2. Download and install GAMS ##

GAMS Studio requires the GAMS low-level APIs. All those files are provided by the GAMS distribution packages, which are available for all major platforms. The installation package for your platform can be obtained from the [GAMS download page](https://www.gams.com/download/). After downloading the package please follow the latest GAMS [installation instructions](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_MAIN.html#UG_INSTALL).

**Note** By default GAMS will run in demo mode. Please check the [download page](https://www.gams.com/download/) for further details.

## 3. Get the GAMS Studio source code ##

Download the GAMS Studio sources from GitHub (via git or as zip archive). All information about the usage of this program can be found within the [GAMS Documentation](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/T_STUDIO.html).

## 4. Building the GAMS Studio project ##

Start Qt Creator, open the project file `gams-studio.pro` and click `Build -> Run qmake`. This generates the file `gamsinclude.pri` that defines the default location of the GAMS installation location. The path within the `gamsinclude.pri` may have to be updated to the correct GAMS installation location on your system.

On Windows the file contains:
```
GAMS_DISTRIB=C:/GAMS/35
GAMS_DISTRIB_C_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C/api
GAMS_DISTRIB_CPP_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C++/api
```
On Unix it will look like:
```
GAMS_DISTRIB=$$(HOME)/gams/gams35.0_linux_x64_64_sfx
GAMS_DISTRIB_C_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C/api
GAMS_DISTRIB_CPP_API=$$GAMS_DISTRIB/apifiles/C++/api
```

Then perform a `Build All` operation (`Build -> Build All`) to build the project. Finally, the GAMS Studio can be executed by triggering `Run` button or pressing `Ctrl + R`.
